To get started with a React project using Vite and TypeScript, follow these steps:

# Step 1: Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can verify by running:

```
node -v
```
# Step 2: Set Up a New Vite Project with React and TypeScript

Open your terminal and use the following commands:

1. Create a new Vite project:
```
npm create vite@latest
```
2. You’ll be prompted to provide a project name. Enter a name, or press Enter to use the default name:
```
✔ Project name: … my-vite-react-ts-app
```
3. Select React as the framework and React + TypeScript as the variant.
```
✔ Select a framework: › React
✔ Select a variant: › React + TypeScript
```
4. After creating the project, navigate to the project folder:

```
cd my-vite-react-ts-app
```

# Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```
# Step 4: Run the Project
You can start the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start Vite’s development server and provide you with a local URL, typically `http://localhost:5173`, where you can view your application.

# Step 5: Open the Project in a Code Editor

Open your project in an editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to start writing TypeScript-based React code.
